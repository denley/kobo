# Kobo

An open-source Super Mario World ROM editor and build system.
Desktop app for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Early scoping stage; nothing is built yet.

## Principles

1. **Open source.** The community must be able to read, fork, and customise everything.
2. **ROMs are compiled from source.** A project is a directory of level files, sprites, blocks, ASM,
   graphics, overworld definitions, etc, and a manifest. The build takes a clean SMW ROM plus that
   directory and produces a ROM. Builds are repeatable and byte-identical for identical inputs.
   Projects are git-friendly.
3. **Everything is scriptable.** Every operation lives in a core library. The GUI and the CLI are
   thin shells over it. Batchable operations (build, import, export, validate, diff, render) are
   exposed on the CLI. Interactive editing is a GUI concern; programmatic editing goes through a
   scripting API, not CLI flags.
4. **Compatibility with existing tools**. The built ROM must use the same
   hijacks, tables, and data layouts that Lunar Magic installs, so PIXI, GPS, UberASM Tool, AddmusicK,
   Asar patches, and custom sprite display files (.ssc, .mwt, .mw2, .s16) keep working. Importing an 
   existing Lunar Magic hack (MWL, Map16, ExGFX, palettes) is a first-class feature. Exceptions may be
   tolerated but heavily discouraged and scrutinised.

## Guardrails

- **Reuse the open-source toolchain.** Orchestrate Asar, PIXI, GPS, UberASM Tool, and AddmusicK.
  Do not reimplement them. Pin tool versions.
- **Patch-based, not disassembly-based.** the build patches a vanilla ROM. Do not build on a full
  SMW disassembly (e.g. SMWDisX); it breaks every fixed-address patch in the ecosystem. Keep the
  architecture from precluding it, but do not pursue it.
- **The vanilla ROM never lives in a project.** Reference it by hash. Locate it through per-user
  config or an environment variable. Never commit or distribute ROM data. Support BPS patch output.
- **Canonical source formats are textual and merge-friendly.** One object or sprite per line where
  practical. Binary formats (MWL, Map16 exports, raw GFX) are import/export interop only.
  Round-trip fidelity against Lunar Magic exports is tested, not assumed.
- **ROM-side code is source.** Anything the editor installs into the ROM (level format expansion,
  custom sprite loading, and so on) is an Asar patch checked into this repo.
- **Determinism is a requirement.** Fixed tool order, deterministic freespace allocation, pinned
  versions. Design for incremental builds; AddmusicK is slow.
- **Support SA-1 from the start.** Address mapping (LoROM, SA-1, FastROM) is an abstraction, never
  hard-coded.
- **SMW only.** Keep game facts data-driven inside the library, but do not build a game-agnostic
  engine.
- **Compatibility comes from documented formats.** Base Lunar Magic compatibility on the ROM and
  file formats documented by the community (SMWCentral). We can inspect ROM outputs from
  Lunar Magic, but do not disassemble or reverse-engineer the Lunar Magic executable.
- **Scope discipline.** Do not chase Lunar Magic feature parity before shipping something usable.
- **License is MPL-2.0 across the board.** Application, core library, CLI, and ROM-side patches.
  New dependencies must be MPL-compatible; check each tool's license before adopting it.

## Roadmap (in order)

1. Core library and CLI that reads a vanilla or Lunar-Magic-modified ROM and renders any level to
   PNG. Validate parsers against real hacks.
2. Build pipeline with native level, Map16, ExGFX, and palette insertion in the Lunar Magic layout,
   plus MWL import. Lunar Magic users can adopt the build while still editing in Lunar Magic.
3. GUI level editor.
4. Overworld, Layer 3, graphics and palette editing, emulator integration
   (play-from-level, Mesen-S / bsnes-plus debugging).

## Open decisions

- Core language and GUI toolkit. Leaning Rust for the core (Asar has a C library API). GUI choice
  deferred until the library exists.
- Level rendering: hand-written object rendering vs executing the ROM's own routines in a
  headless 65816 core. Prototype before committing.
- At what level can/will baseroms be supported?

## Prior art to know

- Lunar Helper / Callisto (build orchestration), Lunar Monitor (auto-export for git).
- pokeemerald + Porymap (the source-first editor model for another game).
- SMWCentral documentation of Lunar Magic's ROM formats and hijacks.
